## DataSource configuration
DataSource used for this Spring Boot application is MySQL database.

DataSource can be configured **either** of the following 2 ways:
1. Application properties in `application.yml`
2. Programmatically through JavaConfig class

`Tip:` Both can be combined to configure multiple datasources.
